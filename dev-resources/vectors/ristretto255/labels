Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso coffee
made with the normal amount of ground coffee but extracted with
about half the amount of water in the same amount of time
by using a finer grind.
This produces a concentrated shot of coffee per volume.
Just pulling a normal shot short will produce a weaker shot
and is not a Ristretto as some believe.
